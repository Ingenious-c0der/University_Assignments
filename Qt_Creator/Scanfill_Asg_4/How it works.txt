At the core of the logic , I have created 2 float arrays x_l[] and x_r[] and these arrays 
contain the information about the leftmost point and right most point of the polygon for a 
given y.For filling these arrays up you need the travel points (transition between the points) to initialize each value
while traversing for left hand side and right hand side pixels of the polygon.The advantage of this algorithm is a x_l and x_r 
run completely differently and are not related.

Some Fixes still required -  (not implemented yet)
1.The point order in the array matters , which should not matter 
Solution - Construct a correspondance list for x1 and sort y1

2.The end point needs to be in both the lists - 
Solution - if x[1] at ymax append it in the list
